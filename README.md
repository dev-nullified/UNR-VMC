# VMC-TAP

## Project Overview

### Brief Description

The Veteran Military Center Tracking and Analytics Program (VMC-TAP) is an application developed for Software Engineering (CS 425) and Senior Projects in Computer Science (CS 426) during the fall 2019 and spring 2020 semesters. CS 425/426 are required capstone courses for a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering (CSE) from the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR).

### Motivation

The primary purpose of TAP is to gain insights about veteran and non-veteran activity at the Veteran Military Center, at on-campus events, and at off-campus events. The hope of Veteran Services is to better understand veteran and non-veteran activity at UNR to enhance/improve their services and engage with more veteran and non-veteran members of the university.

Currently, without TAP, the VMC does not have a sophisticated method for tracking veteran engagement. Without a system to collect, store, manage, and analyze data, most events sponsored by Veteran Services are tracked by hand. Reports related to events are also generated managed manually in Microsoft Excel. These methods are often prone to errors and can contain bad data. In addition, Veteran Services does not have the ability to perform robust analysis internally or externally about veteran and non-veteran engagement.

#### Primary Functions

TAP's primary functions/responsibilities can be classified at a high-level as the following:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Storage
3. Data Management
4. Data Quality Improvements
5. Data Analysis
6. Data Visualization
