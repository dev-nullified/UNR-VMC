This paper will discuss Team 20's project called Veteran Military Center Tracking and Analytics Program (VMC-TAP). The plan is to develop an analytical program for the Veteran Military Center (VMC) here at the University of Nevada, Reno. This program will help make reports and graphs based on data the center collects through scanners and the Office of Data and Analytics. Team 20 will also build a database that can store all of the collected data. The paper also describes the market potential of the project. VMC-TAP arose from a need for the Veteran Military Center to collect, store, and report on information from their attendance scanners. Having a company build a new database from scratch can be expensive. Team 20 will provide a free software engineering services that will produce a product with the same quality as other professional companies.
