% REMOVE THIS LATER, I AM JUST USING IT TO SHOW HOW TO DO CITATIONS ONCE THE REFERENCE HAS BEEN CREATED IN THE 'main.bib' FILE.

This paper discussion Team 20's project. The plan is to develop an analytical program for the Veteran Military Center (VMC) here at the University of Nevada, Reno. This program will help make reports and graphs based on data the center collects through scanners and the Office of Analytics. Team 20 will also build a database that can store all of the collected data. The paper also describes the market potential of the project. There is a lot of need for scanners to collect information from bar-codes and have this information stored in a database. Having a company build a new database from scratch can be expensive. Our team can provide free services that will be the same quality as the other companies.

% MAKE SURE ALL REFERENCES HAVE ':#' where # is that references number in the list so that you can type just the number i.e. '1' and it will know it relates to 'EXAMPLE_REFERENCE' when you use the \cite keyword.
